2. Open your own input from the matching day
3. Save it as a text file in the matching day folder (careful to name it ***input.txt***)

## Personal Note
I usually try to participate each year to break the monotomy of work, look at other people's solutions for new perspectives or face palm myself when someone throws in a one liner or an Excel solution. It trully is a fun activity, and I recommend everyone to try it at least for a few days, and don't give up if they miss a day or more.
